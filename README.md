# Hackman

> A basic (for now) management system for hackspaces and makerspaces.

**Note:** This project is not ready yet - nowhere near. It's mostly a side project that I hope to dump some more time into.

This repository contains everything you need to get started with building and spinning up the system. It will not contain much code itself, and the UI and API will live in separate repositories.
